The Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (abbreviated as NeurIPS) is the main machine learning conference.

We take the opportunity of the upcoming virtual NeurIPS 2021 conference to hold an **in-person NeurIPS event in Paris on December 8**. The goal of the event is to provide an opportunity for students, academics and industry researchers, to connect and discuss ML research presented at NeurIPS. Furthermore, we invite those who have an accepted paper at NeurIPS 2021 to present their work to a live audience.

Warning: the sanitary situation is evolving quickly. We are trying to respond to this with minimal disruption to our event. For now, the main change is that we will not be able to provide a lunch, and you will have to grab a lunch in one of the multiple food venues in the neighborhood. See the updated schedule below.

## Venue

This event will take place at [Sorbonne Center on Artificial Intelligence](https://scai.sorbonne-universite.fr) (SCAI) on the Jussieu campus (Paris 5ème).

## Registration

Registration is closed. There are nearly 150 people on the waiting list. **If you are unable to participate in the day, please inform us ASAP so that we give your seat to someone else.**

Note: this is an in-person conference event that some of the registrants (namely, PhD candidates who have started their gigs over the past 2 years) have never experienced due to the Covid situation. If you feel you want at some point to cancel your registration to give better chances for these newcomers to have a slot, please [let us know by mail](mailto:neurips2021paris@gmail.com) (that goes as well for papers with many authors, please consider not registering all of them).

In the afternoon, we offer PhD and postdoc students the opportunity to participate in **mentoring roundtables with advanced researchers**. Each table will be composed of 2 « senior »  researchers and about 10 PhD/postdoc students. Possible topics of discussion include careers, work-life balance in academia, research ethics, choice of research topics, reproducible research and open source, contrast between academic and industrial research, networking in academia, international researchers in France… More information on this [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Re-2y3GyIZf9SuROiLgHu1beTaIslrfKd_VoBTcjpWY/edit#gid=493703907?usp=sharing).

## Covid regulations

**In order to access the conference, people need to comply with the regulation of Sorbonne Université and be equipped with a “pass sanitaire”.** You therefore need to be able to present a vaccination certificate or up to date negative test certificate or proof of having recovered from Covid.
